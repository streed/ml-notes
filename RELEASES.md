   ```bash
   make release
   # Upload files from dist/release/
   ```

### Installation Script Issues

Test the installation script locally:
```bash
./install.sh --platform linux-amd64 --version v1.0.0

## Security Releases

For security updates:
1. Follow responsible disclosure
2. Prepare patches privately
3. Release simultaneously with disclosure
4. Update all supported versions
5. Notify users via security advisory

## Rollback Procedure

If a release has critical issues:
1. Mark the release as pre-release on GitHub
2. Create a patch release with fixes
3. Update installation script to skip bad version
4. Notify users of the issue

## Automation

The release process is largely automated via GitHub Actions:
- Tests run on every push
- Binaries build on tag push
- Release artifacts upload automatically

See `.github/workflows/ci.yml` for details.
