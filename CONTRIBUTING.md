- **Provide specific examples**
- **Describe the behavior you observed and what you expected**
- **Include system information** (OS, Go version, etc.)
- **Include debug output** if relevant (`ml-notes --debug`)

### Suggesting Enhancements

Enhancement suggestions are welcome! Please provide:

- **A clear and descriptive title**
- **A detailed description of the proposed enhancement**
- **Explain why this enhancement would be useful**
- **List any alternative solutions you've considered**

### Pull Requests

1. **Follow the style guidelines**
2. **Write tests for new functionality**
3. **Update documentation as needed**
4. **Ensure all tests pass**
5. **Write a clear commit message**

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.22 or higher
- CGO support
- Make
- Git

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ml-notes.git
cd ml-notes

# Add upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/streed/ml-notes.git

# Install dependencies
make deps

# Build the project
make build

# Run tests
make test

# Run with race detector during development
make dev
```

### Recommended Development Workflow

1. **Create a feature branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes and test:**
   ```bash
   make test
   make lint
   ```

3. **Commit your changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add new feature"
   ```

4. **Push to your fork:**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

5. **Create a Pull Request** on GitHub

## Style Guidelines

### Go Code Style

- Follow standard Go conventions
- Use `gofmt` for formatting
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for exported functions
- Keep functions small and focused
- Handle errors appropriately

### Code Organization

```go
// Good: Clear function with error handling
func ProcessNote(note *Note) error {
    if note == nil {
        return fmt.Errorf("note cannot be nil")
    }
    
    // Process the note
    if err := validateNote(note); err != nil {
        return fmt.Errorf("validation failed: %w", err)
    }
    
    return nil
}
```

### Running Code Quality Checks

```bash
# Format code
make fmt

# Run linters
make lint

# Run tests with coverage
make test-coverage
```

## Commit Messages

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

- `feat:` - New feature
- `fix:` - Bug fix
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `style:` - Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `test:` - Test additions or changes
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks

### Examples

```
feat: add support for markdown export
fix: resolve panic when database is locked
docs: update installation instructions
refactor: simplify embedding generation logic
test: add tests for vector search
```

## Testing

### Writing Tests

- Write unit tests for new functions
- Include both positive and negative test cases
- Use table-driven tests where appropriate
- Mock external dependencies

### Example Test

```go
func TestProcessNote(t *testing.T) {
    tests := []struct {
        name    string
        note    *Note
        wantErr bool
    }{
        {
            name:    "valid note",
            note:    &Note{Title: "Test", Content: "Content"},
            wantErr: false,
        },
        {
            name:    "nil note",
            note:    nil,
            wantErr: true,
        },
    }
    
    for _, tt := range tests {
        t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {
            err := ProcessNote(tt.note)
            if (err != nil) != tt.wantErr {
                t.Errorf("ProcessNote() error = %v, wantErr %v", err, tt.wantErr)
            }
        })
    }
}
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run tests for specific package
go test ./internal/embeddings/...

# Run with verbose output
go test -v ./...

# Run with race detector
go test -race ./...
```
